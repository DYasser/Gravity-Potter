# Gravity-Potter

Runner type game developed using `Unity` in a competition against different teams. Coded in a limited time with limited Unity knowledge at that time.

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/Gravity-Potter.git` and have `Unity` installed and initialized. You can run the file then by entering `Unity` and running the program from there.

## Gameplay:

A game where the player switches gravity between two platforms to dodge the enemies coming from the right and score the most amount of points by gathering coins that are generated randomly.

I gave the option to either **right click** or press **space** to switch the gravity of the character.
